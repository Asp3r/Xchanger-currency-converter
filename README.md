## Project Description

This software was created as a final project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module in the Back-End Programmer with Java training course from Alura ONE (Training provided by Alura and Oracle ONE together). This simple console program's function is to receive a value and a currency from the user (currently limited to 6 currencies) and convert it to another of the six currencies currently accepted by the program.

## Tools Used

This program uses the following technologies:
- Java: The language in which the program is currently written.
- ExchangeRate-API: A currency conversion API (https://www.exchangerate-api.com) from which updated information on multiple currencies is obtained.

## Future Plans

This program is planned to be improved with future updates. The main improvements intended to be added are:
- Make the application accept all the currencies offered by ExchangeRate-API (instead of just the current 6)
- Add a conversion history that persists over time using batch files and .txt files
- Make the program available in English instead of just Spanish
